## House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

 The purpose of this project is predicting the final price of a house based on distinctive features. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle Competition and displays the prices and features of sold residential houses in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.
 
 Since the predicted value is continuous, Advanced Regression algorithms will be used such as Linear regression, Random Forest, etc. I used R and Weka  to solve this problem.

### Dataset
This project uses the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle’s competition. Thedataset contains 2920 observationsand 79 explanatory variables(predictors) describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset is divided into equal train and test datasets except that sales price is not included in the test data as this is our target variable.

The dataset contains 36 numerical values and 43 categorical values. The numerical attributes mostly represent features related to either physical space of the property such as square footage, or time related attributes like when the house was built or sold, or amenities related attributes such as “how many rooms or bathrooms?”, or subjective condition and quality attributes. The categorical attributes represent additional details of house features such as the presence or absence of fireplace, pool, utilities, ... etc.
