# Project1
# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

## The purpose of this project is predicting the final price of a house based on distinctive features.
## The dataset is obtained from Kaggle Competition and displays the prices and features of sold residential houses in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.
## The dataset is divided into equal train and test datasets except that sales price is not included in the test data as this is our target variable. 
## Since the predicted value is continuous, Advanced Regression algorithms will be used such as Linear regression, Random Forest, etc. I used R and Weka  to solve this problem.
