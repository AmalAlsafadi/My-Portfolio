# Project1
## House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

 The purpose of this project is predicting the final price of a house based on distinctive features. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle Competition and displays the prices and features of sold residential houses in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.
 
 Since the predicted value is continuous, Advanced Regression algorithms was used such as Linear regression, Random Forest, etc. I used R and Weka  to solve this problem.


Tasks:
- Data cleaning and missing data imputation
- The skewedfeatures have been log transformed.
- Linear regression model was used with all variables as our benchmark model. 
- Afterword regularization has been used to improve the prediction. 
- We used Lasso, Ridge, Elasticnet and Random Forest regression models and tuned their parameters to get the best model. 
- the best score RMSE=12055 was achieved by using Lasso Regression with all variables.
